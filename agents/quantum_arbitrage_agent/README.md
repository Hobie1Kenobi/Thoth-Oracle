# Quantum Arbitrage Agent

This agent uses quantum computing techniques to identify and execute complex arbitrage opportunities on the XRPL network. It leverages quantum circuits to process market data and identify profitable trading paths.

## Features

- Quantum-enhanced market data processing
- Complex arbitrage path identification
- Real-time trade execution
- Performance tracking and optimization
- Integration with XRPL Oracle for market data

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PennyLane quantum computing framework
- XRPL-py library
- See requirements.txt for full dependencies

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure your XRPL wallet:
```python
from xrpl.wallet import Wallet
wallet = Wallet.create()  # For testing
```

3. Initialize the agent:
```python
from quantum_arbitrage_agent import QuantumArbitrageAgent
agent = QuantumArbitrageAgent(client, wallet, initial_balance=1000)
```

## Usage

```python
# Run the agent
await agent.run(interval=60)  # Check for opportunities every 60 seconds
```

## How it Works

1. **Quantum Circuit**: The agent uses a parameterized quantum circuit to process market data and identify patterns that might indicate profitable arbitrage opportunities.

2. **Feature Encoding**: Market data (prices, volumes, etc.) is encoded into quantum states using rotation gates.

3. **Quantum Processing**: The circuit applies entangling operations and parameterized rotations to process the encoded data.

4. **Measurement**: The final quantum state is measured to produce trading signals.

5. **Classical Post-processing**: The quantum measurements are combined with classical algorithms to identify specific arbitrage paths.

## Trading Strategy

The agent focuses on identifying three types of arbitrage:

1. **Triangular Arbitrage**: Trading across three currency pairs to profit from price inconsistencies.
2. **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences across different AMM pools.
3. **Statistical Arbitrage**: Using quantum-enhanced pattern recognition to identify temporary price divergences.

## Risk Management

- Minimum profit threshold to filter out low-profit opportunities
- Confidence scoring using quantum signal strength
- Position size management based on wallet balance
- Transaction fee consideration in profit calculations

## Performance Metrics

The agent tracks:
- Return on Investment (ROI)
- Success rate of executed trades
- Average profit per trade
- Quantum circuit confidence scores
